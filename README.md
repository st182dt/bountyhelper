## **Collector's Bounty Helper!**

Maximize your loot during the **Collector's Bounty** event!

For a limited time, drop rates for legacy mounts are **massively increased**, and **Bounty Helper** is the one tool you need to **farm them all!**

This addon was designed **specifically for the event**.

It exclusively lists mounts with boosted drop rates and turns your chaotic farm into a **simple, organized to-do list**.
